# Site Concept

## Site Owner Goals

 - Provide a secure and scalable platform to sell and manage subscription-based box offerings.
 - Allow users to easily subscribe to recurring boxes or gift one-off boxes to others.
 - Enable users to manage their own subscriptions (pause, cancel, change address).
 - Maintain full control over box offerings, shipment schedules, and customer data.
 - Ensure clear separation between admin and regular user functionality for operational security.
 - Offer a professional, responsive, and accessible user interface across all devices.
 - Integrate Stripe or a similar secure payment gateway to handle recurring billing and one-off payments.
 - Track and manage recurring orders and payments tied to active subscriptions.
 - Provide a reliable mechanism for scheduling box shipments based on renewal dates.
 - Deploy the platform on scalable, cloud-based infrastructure with minimal downtime.
 - Reduce support load through clear UI, meaningful feedback, and user-accessible history.

## Visitor Goals

 - Browse available subscription box options and view what types of products they typically include.
 - View detailed info about each months box: theme, contents summary, and shipping frequency options.
 - Easily subscribe to a box for themselves or send it as a gift to another address.
 - Register and log in to manage subscriptions, update shipping details, and view upcoming shipments.
 - Pause or cancel their subscription without needing to contact support.
 - View order history, upcoming delivery dates, and previous payments in one place.
 - Check payment method details and update card info securely if needed.
 - Receive confirmation emails for each successful order and payment.
 - Use a mobile-friendly, accessible site with support for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
 - Feel confident that their personal and payment information is handled securely.
 - Get help or support quickly if they run into issues with orders, addresses, or billing.
