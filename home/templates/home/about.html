  <p>Hobby Hub is a subscription box for miniature painters, model builders, and tabletop creatives. Whether you're just starting out or you're already deep in the hobby, our goal is simple:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>Deliver inspiration to your door, every single month.</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Each box includes a curated mix of paints, brushes, miniatures, accessories, and surprises — chosen to help you try new things, keep your queue fresh, and rekindle your hobby joy.</p>

  <p>We're hobbyists too. We know what it's like to get stuck in a rut, overwhelmed by your pile of shame, or just unsure what to try next. That’s why each box is built not just for quality, but for creative momentum.</p>

  <p>No algorithms. No excess plastic. Just thoughtful selections, delivered monthly.</p>
